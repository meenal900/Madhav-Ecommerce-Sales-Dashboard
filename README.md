Objective:

I collaborated with the proprietor of the Madhav Store to create a comprehensive dashboard for tracking and analyzing their online sales across India. The dashboard provides informative data and smart visualizations to enhance decision-making and sales strategies.


The project's learnings:

• Developed a tracking and analysis dashboard for online sales information.

• Used filters and slicers to customize spreadsheets and drill down using sophisticated parameters.

• Created connections, join new tables, and calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations.

• Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.).
